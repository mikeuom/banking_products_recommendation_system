    "# üìä Customer Spending Pattern Analysis & Credit Card Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**:  \n",
    "This notebook identifies specific customer segments based on their historical spending patterns to recommend targeted cashback credit cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow Overview**:\n",
    "- Start with transaction data for customers identified as suitable prospects (**new addition**).\n",
    "- Categorize customer transactions using Merchant Category Codes (**MCCs**).\n",
    "- Create distinct customer segments using unsupervised clustering (KMeans).\n",
    "- Determine dominant spending categories per segment.\n",
    "- Recommend tailored cashback credit cards based on spending patterns.\n",
    "- Apply a threshold to ensure recommendations target customers with meaningful affinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**üîë Key Change from Earlier Version**:  \n",
    "Instead of using all customers, this notebook specifically analyzes only those customers already identified by our preliminary binary classification model (`recommend_card`) as suitable for credit card recommendations.\n"

    "## üóÇÔ∏è Phase 0: Loading Transaction Data and Filtering Prospects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**:  \n",
    "Load raw transaction data and filter it down to include **only customers flagged** by our previous supervised binary model as strong candidates for credit card offerings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "- Load raw transaction dataset (`transaction_data.csv`).\n",
    "- Load results from binary classification model (`customer_recommendation_flags.csv`), which identifies customers as either `1` (recommended for a credit card) or `0` (not recommended).\n",
    "- Filter the transaction dataset to retain only transactions related to customers flagged as suitable (`recommend_card == 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasoning**:  \n",
    "Focusing only on recommended customers improves targeting effectiveness, reducing resource wastage on unlikely prospects.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Purpose**:  \n",
    "Translate detailed Merchant Category Codes (**MCCs**) from transaction data into broader, meaningful spending categories (e.g., Fuel, Travel, Entertainment).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "- Define a clear mapping (`credit_card_categories`) from specific MCC codes to high-level spending categories.\n",
    "- Create an inverse mapping (`mcc_to_cat`) for quick MCC-to-category lookups.\n",
    "- Map each individual transaction's MCC code to the corresponding spending category. Transactions with unknown MCCs are labeled as `UNMAPPED`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasoning**:  \n",
    "Grouping specific transactions into broad categories makes it easier to interpret customer spending habits clearly and intuitively.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Purpose**:  \n",
    "Summarize each customer's transactions to understand their spending patterns clearly across different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "- Aggregate transaction amounts per customer, grouped by each spend category.\n",
    "- Transform the aggregated data into a customer-level wide format (`spend_<CATEGORY>`) showing total spend per category.\n",
    "- Calculate the percentage (`spend_<CATEGORY>_pct`) of each category relative to a customer's total spending.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasoning**:  \n",
    "Using relative percentages helps identify the most important spending category per customer, making segments directly comparable regardless of absolute spending levels.\n"
